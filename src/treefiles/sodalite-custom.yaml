# If you want to make your own build of Sodalite, it's a good idea to use this
# file. This is also the default file ./build.sh uses (which can be changed
# with `./build.sh [variant]`; for example, `./build.sh desktop`).
#
# See https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/treefile/ for help.
